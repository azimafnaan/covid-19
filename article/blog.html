        <h2>What is the harmful situation of education due to Pandemic ?</h2>

          Now, the COVID-19 pandemic is threatening to erase many of those
          gains. More than 91 percent of students worldwide have been impacted
          by temporary school closures, according to the United Nations. By
          April, close to 1.6 billion young students were out of school.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some experts fear school closures and the loss of some family incomes
          could keep children out of school indefinitely. “We have worked so
          many years to get kids in school, get them enrolled, and get them to
          stay in school,” says Carolyn Johnson, a Rotary member from Maine,
          USA, who helps Rotary clubs design grants that support education.
          “This is going to put those efforts back years.
        </p>
        <p>
          “Parents who were already on the edge about sending their kids to
          school are just going to throw up their hands and not do it,” she
          adds. “They are literally starving and need the money their kids can
          bring in working.”
        </p>
        <h4>Education is no easy task</h4>

        <p>
          It’s a monumental goal. Even in the best times, educating children is
          far more complex than just getting them into a classroom. Are the
          teachers regularly trained? Do the children have access to proper
          nutrition? Are they physically healthy and well enough to learn? Does
          the school have adequate sanitation? Is there a safe, reliable way for
          teachers and children to get to school? Are there issues at home? Can
          parents help with homework? Does the family’s need for income mean the
          child is working instead of being at school?
        </p>
        <p>
          Safe Passage, or Camino Seguro, was founded 20 years ago by a teacher
          from the U.S. to offer tutoring, nutritious snacks, and care for the
          poorest children, as well as a drop-in center for children who worked
          at the dump. Supported by Rotary clubs that have supplied resources
          and teacher training, the program has kept growing and now includes
          several schools for children in kindergarten through eighth grade.
        </p>
        <p>
          Trae Holland, executive director of Safe Passage, says the program
          uses a learning model that is student-centered, is based on inquiry,
          and that emphasizes experiences and participation.
